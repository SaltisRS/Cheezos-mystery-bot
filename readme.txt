Discord bot to handle item/prize bingo!

Start by creating a discord application in the dev portal.

1. Create and name your bot.
2. Find your discord token and create an invite link with all intents and permission [bot]
3. Create an .env file using the supplied env.txt (rename to .env when filled out)
4. Invite to a server and preferably host on a cheap linux webhost (linode is perfect)
